# MLPlayground
This repository will be organized into a sequence of projects that gradually increase in sophistocation. 
The principle goal of this sequence of projects will be to use some ML techniques in biology applications. 
To begin, though, we need to familiarize ourselves with some simple tools and some of the underlying principles
of machine learning. 

## Organization
This repository will be organized according to the following principles
1. Each sub-project will have its own folder
2. In each sub-project, I will write a .pdf file outlining the nature of the problem, and writing about any of the necessary math 
3. I will provide template code to begin with, but I will eventually stop doing this
4. I will include my own solutions in a sub-folder for the first few sub--problems but I will eventually stop doing this and start working collaboratively instead

## Goals 
Our first goal will be to write several solutions to the digit classification problem. 
We'll break our efforts into the following steps 
1. Set up a development environment
2. Get comfortable with tools like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `tensorflow`
3. Learn some data visualization techniques
4. Implement Linear Least Squares regression
5. Solve some classification problems using Linear Least Squares regression
6. Impliment nonlinear least squares regression
7. Solve some classification problems using nonlinear least squares regression
8. Learn to diagnose under/over fitting
9. Implement some minimization techniques
10. Test our minimization techniques
11. Implement a Neural Network
    

At each step, we will apply our focus to the digit recognition data set provided in ~/data/.
